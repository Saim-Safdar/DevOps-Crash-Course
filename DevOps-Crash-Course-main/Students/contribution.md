# Blogs , I have written
I have written two blogs(third on the way).They are posted over medium.com. My course instructor "Mr Saim Safdar" is my motivation , without him I would not have realized the importance of showing my work to the world, by making a digital presence.
   
## 1. Vagrant , an alternative to Docker?
In this blog I have tried to clear out the confusion that exits especially with those new to DevOps.I have described the two tools in an easy and understandable way and enlightened different aspects of them and have tried to make a comparison of the their performance.
  
Medium Link : https://medium.com/@nazakatejaz.work/vagrant-an-alternative-to-docker-a40b45455d94
       
## 2. Setting up MultiMachine Environment using Vagrant
In this blog , I have described the step by step procedure of creating a MultiMachine Environment on Host OS using vagrant and Oracle VM Manager.In the blog , I have also discussed some use cases.In the guide, I have explained how you can setup configurations inside the vagrantFile.
