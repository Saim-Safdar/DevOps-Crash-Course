# Blogs , I have written
I have written two blogs(third on the way).They are posted over medium.com. My course instructor "Mr Saim Safdar" is my motivation , without him I would not have realized the importance of showing my work to the world, by making a digital presence.
   
## 1. Vagrant , an alternative to Docker?
In this blog I have tried to clear out the confusion that exits especially with those new to DevOps.I have described the two tools in an easy and understandable way and enlightened different aspects of them and have tried to make a comparison of the their performance.
  
Medium Link : https://medium.com/@nazakatejaz.work/vagrant-an-alternative-to-docker-a40b45455d94
       
## 2. Setting up MultiMachine Environment using Vagrant
In this blog , I have described the step by step procedure of creating a MultiMachine Environment on Host OS using vagrant and Oracle VM Manager.In the blog , I have also discussed some use cases.In the guide, I have explained how you can setup configurations inside the vagrantFile.

## Contribution Blogs I Have Written
### [How to Setup Hadoop 3.2.1 Single-Node Cluster on Ubuntu](https://medium.com/@mcheema2010/how-to-setup-hadoop-3-2-1-single-node-cluster-on-ubuntu-641fdc6c2b56)
Apache Hadoop is an open-source framework that is used to efficiently store and process large datasets ranging in size from gigabytes to terabytes of data. In this Blog I have made instruction blog to install Hadoop. 


### [Hadoop Docker Installation](https://medium.com/@mcheema2010/hadoop-docker-installation-d3a6082aac71)
If you are running Hadoop in an environment where you may need mixed Java versions, then running it as a container could isolate the dependencies (in this case, Java) from the host system. Sometimes, it would get you a more easily reproducible artifact to move around and set up. In this Blog I have made instruction blog to install Hadoop using Docker.

### [Linkerd vs Istio](https://medium.com/@mcheema2010/linkerd-vs-istio-f0308c3d1061)
In this I examined Linkerd and Istio tools and evaluate them against various standards in this blog. As the service mesh has been a major advancement in the Kubernetes networking field in recent years.

## My Future Plan

```python

future = ['Implement Techniques Learnt in DevOps in FYP', 
'MLOPs', 'Deployment of FYP on Cloud', 'Open Source Contribution',
'DevOps Seminar in FAST']

for i in future:
    next_semester(i) # To be done in next semester :)
```

## Credits

Thank you Saim Safdar for the excellent course content for DevOps it has given me a great opportunity to understand how DevOps methadologies is helping different organizations deliver applications and services at high velocity.
