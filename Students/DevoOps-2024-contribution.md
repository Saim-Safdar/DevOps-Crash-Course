# DevOps 22024 Students Contributions! 

This course introduces students to the key principles of DevOps, a set of practices that combine software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops) to improve collaboration, automate workflows, and enable continuous delivery. Students will learn how to bridge the gap between development and operations, focusing on automation, monitoring, infrastructure as code (IaC), containerization, and cloud services. This is the space where students can showcase their work based on the course material covered, including published articles, sample GitHub repositories, and links to their public profiles.

Summary:
Infrastructure as Code (IaC) automates the provisioning and management of infrastructure using code, allowing teams to create consistent, scalable environments quickly. It improves efficiency, reduces human error, and ensures infrastructure is version-controlled, just like application code. Adopting IaC practices leads to faster deployments, cost savings, and enhanced system resilience.

What I Learned:
Throughout this process, I learned that IaC not only streamlines and automates infrastructure management but also aligns infrastructure with modern development practices like  modularity and version control. Tools like Terraform and AWS CloudFormation are essential in implementing IaC efficiently.
