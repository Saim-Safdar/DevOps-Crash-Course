# DevOps 22024 Students Contributions! 

This course introduces students to the key principles of DevOps, a set of practices that combine software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops) to improve collaboration, automate workflows, and enable continuous delivery. Students will learn how to bridge the gap between development and operations, focusing on automation, monitoring, infrastructure as code (IaC), containerization, and cloud services. This is the space where students can showcase their work based on the course material covered, including published articles, sample GitHub repositories, and links to their public profiles.

## BLOG: Introduction to Microservices in DevOps

# Summary: 
Microservices break applications into small, independent services that can be developed, deployed, and scaled separately, enhancing flexibility and scalability. DevOps practices like CI/CD, automation, and containerization align well with microservices, enabling faster releases, resilience, and better collaboration. However, managing microservices with DevOps requires careful orchestration and monitoring to handle increased complexity. Together, they create a more agile and reliable software development process.
