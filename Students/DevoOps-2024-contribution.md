# DevOps 22024 Students Contributions! 

This course introduces students to the key principles of DevOps, a set of practices that combine software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops) to improve collaboration, automate workflows, and enable continuous delivery. Students will learn how to bridge the gap between development and operations, focusing on automation, monitoring, infrastructure as code (IaC), containerization, and cloud services. This is the space where students can showcase their work based on the course material covered, including published articles, sample GitHub repositories, and links to their public profiles.

- Cloud computing, like the clouds themselves, brings both beauty and complexity into our digital world. I reflect on my journey with AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud. AWS offers vast possibilities but comes with unpredictability. Azure feels familiar, especially with Microsoftâ€™s ecosystem, but sometimes hides costs. Google Cloud inspires creativity, especially for AI, but has a history of product uncertainty. Ultimately, the choice between these platforms depends on whether you're seeking innovation, reliability, or limitless potential, but each cloud platform shapes the sky of technology in its own unique way.
