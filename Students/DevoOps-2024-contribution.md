# DevOps 22024 Students Contributions! 

This course introduces students to the key principles of DevOps, a set of practices that combine software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops) to improve collaboration, automate workflows, and enable continuous delivery. Students will learn how to bridge the gap between development and operations, focusing on automation, monitoring, infrastructure as code (IaC), containerization, and cloud services. This is the space where students can showcase their work based on the course material covered, including published articles, sample GitHub repositories, and links to their public profiles.

In this blog post, I compared Docker and Podman, focusing on their differences in architecture, security, performance, and ecosystem support. Docker's daemon-based system is well-suited for established workflows, while Podman's daemonless, rootless approach offers better security and resource efficiency. I learned that while Docker is ideal for complex, multi-container applications, Podman excels in security-conscious and lightweight environments.
