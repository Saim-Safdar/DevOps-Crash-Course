# DevOps 22024 Students Contributions! 

This course introduces students to the key principles of DevOps, a set of practices that combine software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops) to improve collaboration, automate workflows, and enable continuous delivery. Students will learn how to bridge the gap between development and operations, focusing on automation, monitoring, infrastructure as code (IaC), containerization, and cloud services. This is the space where students can showcase their work based on the course material covered, including published articles, sample GitHub repositories, and links to their public profiles.

Blog 1: Workings of docker engine https://medium.com/@jawad633/introduction-b1368365c1d2

The Docker Engine blog describes Docker's transition from a 
monolithic architecture to a modular structure, splitting the 
daemon into distinct components: Docker CLI, Daemon, Containerd, and Runc. This modular approach 
enhances Docker's efficiency and reliability, allowing better management of container lifecycles and
interactions with the host system.
