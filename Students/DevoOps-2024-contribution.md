# DevOps 22024 Students Contributions! 

This course introduces students to the key principles of DevOps, a set of practices that combine software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops) to improve collaboration, automate workflows, and enable continuous delivery. Students will learn how to bridge the gap between development and operations, focusing on automation, monitoring, infrastructure as code (IaC), containerization, and cloud services. This is the space where students can showcase their work based on the course material covered, including published articles, sample GitHub repositories, and links to their public profiles.

- Optimizing Docker containers for low-resource environments is crucial for efficient performance, cost savings, and scalability, especially on edge devices, IoT systems, or small virtual machines. Key strategies include minimizing image size with lightweight base images and multi-stage builds, managing resources by setting CPU and memory limits, optimizing application code, and fine-tuning Docker settings. Using monitoring tools like `cAdvisor`, `Prometheus`, and `Grafana` can help track and enhance container performance, ensuring smooth operation even in constrained environments.
