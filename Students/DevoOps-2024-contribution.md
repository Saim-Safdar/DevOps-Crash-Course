# DevOps 22024 Students Contributions! 

This course introduces students to the key principles of DevOps, a set of practices that combine software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops) to improve collaboration, automate workflows, and enable continuous delivery. Students will learn how to bridge the gap between development and operations, focusing on automation, monitoring, infrastructure as code (IaC), containerization, and cloud services. This is the space where students can showcase their work based on the course material covered, including published articles, sample GitHub repositories, and links to their public profiles.

Machine learning has revolutionized industries by offering two key approaches: supervised and unsupervised learning. Supervised learning, much like having a teacher, uses labelled data to train machines in making accurate predictions, widely applied in healthcare and finance. Unsupervised learning explores patterns in unlabelled data, useful for tasks like customer segmentation and anomaly detection, though it's harder to evaluate. Both methods have their strengths and challenges, but together, they drive innovation and push the boundaries of technology, making machine learning a vital tool in todayâ€™s world
