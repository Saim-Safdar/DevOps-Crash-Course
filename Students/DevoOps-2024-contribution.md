# DevOps 22024 Students Contributions! 

This course introduces students to the key principles of DevOps, a set of practices that combine software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops) to improve collaboration, automate workflows, and enable continuous delivery. Students will learn how to bridge the gap between development and operations, focusing on automation, monitoring, infrastructure as code (IaC), containerization, and cloud services. This is the space where students can showcase their work based on the course material covered, including published articles, sample GitHub repositories, and links to their public profiles.

- Data preprocessing is a crucial step in any data science project, ensuring that raw data is cleaned, transformed, and made usable for analysis. By addressing issues such as missing values, inconsistencies, and irrelevant information, preprocessing enhances the accuracy and reliability of data models. It lays the foundation for successful data-driven projects, as even the most advanced algorithms rely on well-prepared data to deliver meaningful results.
