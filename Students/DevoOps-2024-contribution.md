# DevOps 22024 Students Contributions! 

This course introduces students to the key principles of DevOps, a set of practices that combine software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops) to improve collaboration, automate workflows, and enable continuous delivery. Students will learn how to bridge the gap between development and operations, focusing on automation, monitoring, infrastructure as code (IaC), containerization, and cloud services. This is the space where students can showcase their work based on the course material covered, including published articles, sample GitHub repositories, and links to their public profiles.

# Summary of my blog 
My exploration of quantum computing revealed that it’s a practical technology rather than just sci-fi, leveraging qubits to perform complex calculations. Key concepts like superposition, entanglement, and interference enable quantum computers to solve problems more efficiently than classical ones. Understanding these principles highlights the transformative potential of quantum technology.
