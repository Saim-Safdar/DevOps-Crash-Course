## Blog “Virtual Machines vs. Docker: What’s the Real Difference?”
- Virtual Machines (VMs) and Docker containers each offer unique advantages for application deployment, with VMs providing robust security, strong isolation. Docker containers, however, are lightweight, efficient, and portable, suitable for modern, agile applications. Both technologies differ significantly in architecture, with VMs virtualizing hardware and Docker sharing the host OS kernel.
