# DevOps 22024 Students Contributions! 

This course introduces students to the key principles of DevOps, a set of practices that combine software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops) to improve collaboration, automate workflows, and enable continuous delivery. Students will learn how to bridge the gap between development and operations, focusing on automation, monitoring, infrastructure as code (IaC), containerization, and cloud services. This is the space where students can showcase their work based on the course material covered, including published articles, sample GitHub repositories, and links to their public profiles.

## Blogs I Have Written
## 1. Blog Post Title: Introduction to Quantum Computing
Summary:
In this blog post, I explore the fundamentals of quantum computing, including key concepts such as qubits, superposition, and entanglement. I discuss how quantum computers differ from classical computers and their potential impact on fields like cryptography, machine learning, and material science.

What I Have Learned:
Through this blog, I gained an understanding of how quantum computing leverages quantum mechanics to solve complex problems much faster than classical computers. I also learned about the current state of quantum computing technology and its future potential in solving real-world problems.

Learning Resources Used:

"Quantum Computing for Everyone" by Chris Bernhardt
IBM Q Experience platform for hands-on practice
Quantum Computing concepts from YouTube tutorials and lectures
