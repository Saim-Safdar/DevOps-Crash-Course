# DevOps 22024 Students Contributions! 

This course introduces students to the key principles of DevOps, a set of practices that combine software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops) to improve collaboration, automate workflows, and enable continuous delivery. Students will learn how to bridge the gap between development and operations, focusing on automation, monitoring, infrastructure as code (IaC), containerization, and cloud services. This is the space where students can showcase their work based on the course material covered, including published articles, sample GitHub repositories, and links to their public profiles.

#Summary
This blog explores the key differences between Docker containers and virtual machines, highlighting their respective architectures, resource utilization, and performance. Docker containers provide a lightweight, efficient alternative to traditional VMs by sharing the host OS kernel, resulting in faster deployment and lower overhead. The analysis underscores the industrial shift towards containerization for improved scalability and flexibility in modern application management.
